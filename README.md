# Windows Programming Course

### Assignment 9 (Windows File Handling):

Write a Windows  Forms application in C# which uses File IO and allows users to select commands through menu items to write and search flight and customer information on their relevant forms. 
The searched data must be displayed on a rich text box. Define a context menu for the rich text box so that it will be possible to change the size and color of the font of the rich text box. 
Data can be saved to files using any of file handling technologies covered in the course (e.g. XML or JSON serialization). When a flight information is searched, the application must print 
the information of all customers on that flight. When a customer information is searched, the application must print the information of customer's flight too. Define separate classes for 
customer and flight information. The attributes for the customer class should be id, name and flight id. Define necessary methods for the class. The attributes for the flight class should be
id, airline company, origin, destination and date. Define necessary methods for the class. Define a handler class which contains necessary methods to take care of File IO operations. 
Test the application and make sure it works according to the requirements.
